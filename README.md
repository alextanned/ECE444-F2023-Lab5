## Advantages of TDD
1. Only necessary code is written: The code is kept as minimal as possible to pass predefined tests. All code integrated into the final product serves a genuine purpose for feature implementation. Every piece of code included in the final product serves a distinct and necessary purpose in implementing a feature as specified by the test cases.
2. Less likelihood of major bug: Since tests are written before the code is written, major bugs that impede the functionality will be caught right away if some test cases do not pass. 
3. Improves documentation: Test cases serve as a clear, unambiguous specification of what the code should do, improving readability.
4. Modularity: Features are implemented step by step only after each corresponding test case has been established. The code becomes more modular and scalable. A new feature is only added if all current test cases have passed.
## Disadvantages of TDD
1. Takes more time: TDD requires writing tests before the actual code, which can be perceived as time-consuming, especially for developers who are new to the methodology.
2. More maintenance: Maintaining a large suite of tests can become an overhead in terms of time and resources. Since tests need to be updated if requirements have changed, writing and updating tests can slow down the development process.
3. No guarantee on time investment: If the requirements of a project are unclear and are rapidly changing, lots of time will be spent on writing test cases that may yield very low reward once requirements have changed.
